# Implement sort algorithms

Write implementations of sort algorithms that take in an unsorted list
and return a sorted list in ascending order (smallest to largest).

# Testing

Write a test to verify that your algorithms are functioning correctly.
Your test should take in a function, run it on a (randomly generated)
input array to produce an output, and check the following things:

1. Number of elements is same as input
2. Each element in the output is smaller than the next element
3. Each element in the input is represented in the output, and all
   elements in the output are found in the input

Your test should produce useful output informing the programmer why the
implementation failed.
It should also report the number of tests passed, and the number of tests
failed.
